    Emryk was searching everywhere for the third number to unlock the treasure
    chest. Recently, he heard of a
    <span class="answer">{animal}</span>
    named
    <span class="answer">{name}</span>
    who told everyone that they knew the third number.
    <span class="answer">{name}</span>
    announced that they would share the third number in exchange for gold coins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Emryk wanted to meet
    <span class="answer">{name}</span>
    but
    <span class="answer">{name}</span>
    lived in
    <span class="answer">{state}</span>. So Emryk asked Asher if he could borrow
    his
    <span class="answer">{transportation}</span>
    to get there. Asher happily agreed to help and let Emryk borrow his
    <span class="answer">{transportation}</span>. Before he left, Mom and Dad
    packed him some food, water, and gave him
    <span class="money-added">{moneyFromParents}</span>
    more coins. Emryk had already saved
    <span class="answer">{number}</span>
    gold coins himself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Emryk had a long way to get to
    <span class="answer">{state}</span>. First, he had to trek though a deep
    jungle. Luckily while he was there, he came across Nana and Pops who gave
    him food and bug spray. Next, he used his
    <span class="answer">{transportation}</span>
    to cross the cold ice fields. Along the way, he saw Auntie Cole and Uncle
    Zach who gave him a blanket and
    <span class="money-added">{moneyFromCAndZ}</span>
    gold coins. After the ice fields, he had to cross a dry desert. He ran out
    of water, so he had to spend
    <span class="money-removed">{moneyForWater}</span>
    gold coins for more water.
  </p>
  <p>
    Emryk finally reached
    <span class="answer">{state}</span>
    and went to see
    <span class="answer">{name}</span>
    in
    <span class="answer">{animal}</span>
    Town.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><span class="answer">{name}</span></strong>
    said: "Hello Emryk. Iâ€™ve heard that you seek the third number. How many gold
    coins have you brought me in exchange?"
